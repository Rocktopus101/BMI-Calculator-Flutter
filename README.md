# BMI-Calculator-Flutter
I've created this BMI Calculator App on flutter following a tutorial by Santos Enoque.   The basic idea behind building this was to practice my flutter skills. It is also my first project on flutter.
-> Input Height in Metres (example: if you're height is 182 cm, input 1.82) 
-> Input Weight in Kilograms. 
-> Program will show you're BMI calculated using the BMI formula and the weight class associated with it.
